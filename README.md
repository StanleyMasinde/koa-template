# 🚀 Koa API Skeleton 🚀

[![Build and test](https://github.com/StanleyMasinde/koa-template/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StanleyMasinde/koa-template/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

A lightweight and robust Koa.js starter template designed specifically for building RESTful APIs. This template focuses on backend functionality, providing a solid foundation for your API projects without any frontend dependencies. It uses strict TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

**Quick Start**

(Coming soon - detailed setup and usage instructions)

**Key Features ✨**

*   **Minimalistic Koa Setup:** Jumpstart your API development with a clean and concise Koa application structure.
*   **Efficient Routing:** Define API endpoints effortlessly using `@koa/router`.
*   **Essential Middleware:** Includes middleware for:
    *   Error Handling ⚙️
    *   Body Parsing (JSON, URL Encoded) 📦
*   **Environment-Based Configuration:** Easily manage different configurations for development, production, and other environments. ⚙️
*   **Robust Testing:** Built-in support for testing with Jest. 🧪
*   **Database Interaction:** Integrated with Knex.js and a custom, minimal ORM for streamlined database access. 🗄️
*   **Strict TypeScript:** Enforces strong typing for improved code quality and maintainability. ⌨️

**Planned Enhancements ✨**

We're continuously working to improve the Koa API Skeleton. Here are some of the features we plan to add:
